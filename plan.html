<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>To make fun, exciting, socialising, and informative website that appeal more to the young people. </p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>

<p>Connect the site into website analytic tools that will count the number of visitors in the website. Counting the number of teams that are being registered into the site are also an achievement. If there are a lot of teams registered, then the site are considered as success. </p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>

<p>So, the design of the site will be simple but have a lot of user interaction that will give an impression of fun and exciting website which is suitable for teenagers and young adults. The feature of the Beach Volleyball will be given as well so the audience will know what the site is all about.</p>
